# Seng 271 Group Project

A group project for SENG 271 (Spring 2013) at UVic for SENG 271 A01. The professor is Jens Weber and the authors of this project are Andrew Hobden (@Hoverbear), Daniel Faulkner (@maxentropic), and Scott Byrne (@mrgoboom).

## Running the Project
The decision was made to use Eclipse (for reasons unknown to me) for this project. Thusly, please follow the sort instructions to get it to run:

1. Clone this Repo or otherwise obtain a copy.
2. Open a recent version of Eclipse (We used 4.3 aka Kepler, along with JRE 1.7)
3. Go `File -> import`
4. In the Import window, expand the folder called `General` and select `Existing Projects into Workspace`
5. Point it to the `Seng271_LudoGame` folder.

We frequently had issues with JRE 1.6 being "Defaulted" to by university machines as well as Macs. If you have this issue you will need to install a version of Java 7.
